As a &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization"&gt;GitHub organiztion owner&lt;/a&gt;,
your role is to ensure that our projects flourish while minimizing unnecessary
interference. To achieve this goal, we ask that you follow these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No owner removes any other owner&lt;/strong&gt; from the organization, except if any of those events happen:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is evidence for credentials being stolen / a malicious owner. Latest 30 minutes after the owner was removed, an &lt;a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues"&gt;issue in py-pdf.github.io&lt;/a&gt; is created. The incident is publicly documented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other owner is not active for at least 12 months. The owner is contacted at least 3 times over at least 3 months. The last e-mail is at least 30 days ago. Am &lt;a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues"&gt;issue in py-pdf.github.io&lt;/a&gt; is created to document it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other owner is harming the project in the way they act publicly (e.g. insulting people in issues). This needs all other owners to agree + an &lt;a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues"&gt;issue in py-pdf.github.io&lt;/a&gt;. If there is only 2 owners in total (one about to be removed) a 75% majority of people voting with "thumbs up" (to remove) vs less than 25% people voting with "thumbs down" (not remove). In that case, there need to be at least 4 non-owners to vote to remove the owner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No owner adds any new owner&lt;/strong&gt; to the organization, except if all of the following conditions are met:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new owner has two-factor authentication enabled (see &lt;a href="https://github.com/settings/security"&gt;security settings&lt;/a&gt; - security keys and authenticator app are preferred), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All other owners agree, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new owner agrees to those rules. In case the new owner has an account successor, the new owner ensures that person also agrees to the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owners typically don't interfere with other projects&lt;/strong&gt;, except if the project itself is at risk (e.g. security issues / no merges for at least 6 months)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those rules can only be changed by all owners agreeing&lt;/strong&gt; on the new version. This "py-pdf owner ruleset" should be documented at https://py-pdf.github.io/. Any change is done by PR / agreement is showed by an approval.&lt;/li&gt;
