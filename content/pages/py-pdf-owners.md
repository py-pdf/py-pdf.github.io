Summary: How py-pdf organization owners agree to act

Welcome to the "py-pdf" organization! As a [GitHub organiztion owner](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization),
your role is to ensure that our projects flourish while minimizing unnecessary
interference. To achieve this goal, we ask that you follow these rules.

## The Rules

1. **No owner removes any other owner** from the organization, except if any of those events happen:
    1. There is evidence for credentials being stolen / a malicious owner. Latest 30 minutes after the owner was removed, an [issue in py-pdf.github.io](https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues) is created. The incident is publicly documented.
    2. The other owner is not active for at least 12 months. The owner is contacted at least 3 times over at least 3 months. The last e-mail is at least 30 days ago. Am [issue in py-pdf.github.io](https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues) is created to document it.
    3. The other owner is harming the project in the way they act publicly (e.g. insulting people in issues). This needs all other owners to agree + an [issue in py-pdf.github.io](https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues). If there is only 2 owners in total (one about to be removed) a 75% majority of people voting with "thumbs up" (to remove) vs less than 25% people voting with "thumbs down" (not remove). In that case, there need to be at least 4 non-owners to vote to remove the owner.
2. **No owner adds any new owner** to the organization, except if all of the following conditions are met:
    1. The new owner has two-factor authentication enabled (see [security settings](https://github.com/settings/security) - security keys and authenticator app are preferred), and
    2. All other owners agree, and
    3. The new owner agrees to those rules. In case the new owner has an account successor, the new owner ensures that person also agrees to the rules.
3. **Owners typically don't interfere with other projects**, except if the project itself is at risk (e.g. security issues / no merges for at least 6 months)
4. **Those rules can only be changed by all owners agreeing** on the new version. This "py-pdf owner ruleset" should be documented at https://py-pdf.github.io/. Any change is done by PR / agreement is showed by an approval.
