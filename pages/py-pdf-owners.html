    <p>Welcome to the "py-pdf" organization! As a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization">GitHub organiztion owner</a>,
your role is to ensure that our projects flourish while minimizing unnecessary
interference. To achieve this goal, we ask that you follow these rules.</p>
<h2>The Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>No owner removes any other owner</strong> from the organization, except if any of those events happen:<ol>
<li>There is evidence for credentials being stolen / a malicious owner. Latest 30 minutes after the owner was removed, an <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues">issue in py-pdf.github.io</a> is created. The incident is publicly documented.</li>
<li>The other owner is not active for at least 12 months. The owner is contacted at least 3 times over at least 3 months. The last e-mail is at least 30 days ago. Am <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues">issue in py-pdf.github.io</a> is created to document it.</li>
<li>The other owner is harming the project in the way they act publicly (e.g. insulting people in issues). This needs all other owners to agree + an <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/py-pdf.github.io/issues">issue in py-pdf.github.io</a>. If there is only 2 owners in total (one about to be removed) a 75% majority of people voting with "thumbs up" (to remove) vs less than 25% people voting with "thumbs down" (not remove). In that case, there need to be at least 4 non-owners to vote to remove the owner.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>No owner adds any new owner</strong> to the organization, except if all of the following conditions are met:<ol>
<li>The new owner has two-factor authentication enabled (see <a href="https://github.com/settings/security">security settings</a> - security keys and authenticator app are preferred), and</li>
<li>All other owners agree, and</li>
<li>The new owner agrees to those rules. In case the new owner has an account successor, the new owner ensures that person also agrees to the rules.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Owners typically don't interfere with other projects</strong>, except if the project itself is at risk (e.g. security issues / no merges for at least 6 months)</li>
<li><strong>Those rules can only be changed by all owners agreeing</strong> on the new version. This "py-pdf owner ruleset" should be documented at https://py-pdf.github.io/. Any change is done by PR / agreement is showed by an approval.</li>
</ol>
